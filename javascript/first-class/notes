A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.
The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.


* Semicolons ;

Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:

let a, b, c;  // Declare 3 variables
a = 5;        // Assign the value 5 to a
b = 6;        // Assign the value 6 to b
c = a + b;    // Assign the sum of a and b to c

When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;

JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.

The let keyword tells the browser to create variables:
